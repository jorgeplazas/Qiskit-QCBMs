**2025-10-24**
Based on the work made by the team during the week, together with various explorations and points discussed during the meeting we arrived the following:
 
 To Do's
 - Check github projects and other tools for workflow organization and team logistics, also add useful hints and guidelines for code testing, project structure etc from e.g. qiskit add on pages (Natalie).
 - Understand the different functions which might be used as a loss function in the training of QCBMs and write initial code for their implementation (Debshata).
 - Write initial code for an updated quiskit version of parts of `GiggleLiu/QuantumCircuitBornMachine` along the lines of Hamilton's 2019 article (Jorge).  
 - Add potential use cases including  those arising from data loading tasks (Natalie).
